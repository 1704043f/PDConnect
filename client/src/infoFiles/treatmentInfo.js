In some cases it can be given continuously via an infusion pump.",

        askDoctor: "Apomorphine is not a treatment appropriate for all Parkinson patients but if you are having regular or sudden, unpredictable wear off symptoms not controlled by other medications, then it might be an option for you. Discuss with your doctor whether apomorphine is appropriate for you and particularly whether changes to your other Parkinson medications should be tried first to improve symptoms before considering apomorphine. Also discuss with your doctor the side effects oF apomorphine and how easy it will be for you to inject yourself or have a caregiver or family member do it for you.",
